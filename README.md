# First-Capstone-MVP
This is my implementation of my  MVP there is no css because there is no style
User searches for book suggestions and it returns back only books.

#Note for grader
I along with a technical coach were unable to recreate the scenario where the grader was getting non books back. I am specifying books in my API request.

About moving over Qloo I still waiting to hear back from them about API access. But the website does state that the tastdive api will continue to supported until full merger happens
